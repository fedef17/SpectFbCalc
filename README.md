# Radiance Spectra Analysis and EC-Earth Model Validation
## Description
This software calculates and visualizes the spectral variance of radiance using synthetic kernels and variable anomalies. 
It aims to assist in validating the EC-Earth climate model, particularly through comparison with IASI measurements and using the σ-IASI radiative transfer model.

## Motivation
This project aims to trace spectral anomalies in radiances back to their contributing atmospheric variables. 
By leveraging outputs from the EC-Earth model (without the COSP-σ-IASI simulator activated), this work seeks to: 
1. Reverse-engineer the simulator's results.
2. Analyze how variations in individual climate variables influence spectral biases.
This approach will ultimately provide insights into improving the tuning of climate models and understanding biases in simulated radiances.

## Features
- Synthetic Data Generation: Produces synthetic spectral kernels and random variable variances for initial testing and structure development.
- Anomaly Computation: Calculates spectral anomalies to analyze the contribution of variable changes to radiances.
- Plotting Tools: Visualizes radiance spectra and anomalies.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started
### Install Conda
Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maalbanese/MC_forum.git
cd MC_forum
```
### Set up the Environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate radspect
```
### Run the Notebook
Open **`main.ipynb`** in Jupyter and run the cells.

## Usage
- Input: Tuned parameter deltas (**`deltax`**) and synthetic kernels generated by **`get_spectral_kernels`**.
- Output: Radiance spectra and their variance across different wavenumber bands.

## Future Goals 
- Replace synthetic kernels and random variable variances with data from EC-Earth simulations.
- Perform anomaly calculations to validate the COSP-σ-IASI simulator.
- Identify and quantify how each variable contributes to radiance biases in specific spectral bands.
