# Our fantastic library!

Tools for the calculation of radiative feedbacks and visualization, both broadband and spectrally resolved. The code consists of a general library `spectfbcalc/spectfbcalc_lib.py` to perform fundamental operations (e.g. feedback calculation) and example notebooks/scripts ready to use.

### Installation

Just run install.sh script from the main directory: `bash install.sh`. A working mamba/conda installation is needed to create the environment.

### Usage

Have a look at `spectfbcalc/test_fbcalc.ipynb` for a usage example.
